It included a 4 step application process\n            for employees through an Ionic app. The Laravel administration panel\n            registered assignments which linked employees with hirers for hourly\n            registrations. Invoiced hirers for every hour worked, generated a\n            monthly excel file which was automatically forwarded to a web\n            service by the payrolling system which paid employees, and much\n            more.\n          </Paragraph>\n        </TimelineItem>\n      </TimelineRow>\n      <TimelineRow>\n        <TimelineItem\n          type={ItemType.Professional}\n          dates=\"01-2015 &mdash; 04-2016\"\n          title=\"NoProtocol\"\n          subtitle=\"Fullstack Webdeveloper\"\n          tags=\"Laravel, Vue.js, Vuex\"\n        >\n          <Paragraph>\n            At NoProtocol I started as a supporting minion to the lead developer\n            of the Laravel system hihonor.com and grew into having technical\n            ownership of the project over several months when the lead left.\n            Building all updates to the site, enabling new campaigns and general\n            maintenance.
